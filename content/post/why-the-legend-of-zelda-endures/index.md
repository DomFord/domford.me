[I was recently interviewed by DR](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kultur/gaming/en-af-de-bedste-nogensinde-derfor-er-legendarisk-spilserie-stadig-et), the Danish public broadcaster, about the what makes the The Legend of Zelda series so enduring and popular for the occasion of its 35th anniversary. On this day in 1986, *The Legend of Zelda* on the Famicom. With [a score of 97 on Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild), *Breath of the Wild*, released 32 years later, doesn't suggest that the series that has grown long in the tooth.

I was asked to explain what was so special about The Legend of Zelda that it could survive and thrive for so long. From an academic perspective, I avoid making value statements--that's the job of reviewers and opinion piece writers. The series is clearly successful, and also happen to like it a lot. But the more interesting question to me was in what makes a videogame series longlasting. And, more than that, what makes it also so consistently loved. Plenty of other series have a long list of titles--Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed, for instance--but few seem so consistently acclaimed: the vast majority of Zelda games have [a Metacritic score in the 90s](https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/legend-of-zelda-games-ranked-worst-to-best), and ususally in the mid-to-high 90s. (I'm aware of [the many problems with using Metacritic](https://kotaku.com/metacritic-matters-how-review-scores-hurt-video-games-472462218), but it does, at least, offer a way to see at a glance when a game is near-univerally acclaimed, especially ones which have been out for a while.)

I thought a lot about the question both in the relatively short period before the phone call but also in the days after. I wanted to write this as a way to just get out there all the stuff I wish I'd said at the time, or that I've thought more about since.

There are two elements I want to highlight. And here I'm taking as given the fact that these are just solidly designed games made by now-seasoned veterens with plenty of resources from Nintendo.

# Familiarity and strangeness

I said in the interview that one reason for The Legend of Zelda's success is that it strikes a balance between familiarity and strangeness. Each game feels at the same time like home and like a new adventure. There's enough to latch onto that starting a new Zelda game isn't a great undertaking in learning an alien world and getting to grips with obscure lore. But there's always enough difference that exploring Hyrule for the fifteenth time still feels like a new place, and nor does it feel like the same game with a new skin.

This is a balance that many other long-running series fail to strike. Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed, to return to those examples, are both series that have suffered at one point or another from too much familiarity. Probably not coincidentally, this issue mostly came to the fore when they are annualised. New titles began to feel like last year's game with a slightly different set of missions. Clearly, these are still enormously successful series, but each title isn't *loved* in the same way as Zelda titles. There's a near consensus that Call of Duty began to get very dull and samey after *Modern Warfare 2*, and Assassin's Creed from *III* onwards (often with the exception of *Black Flag*) until it stopped annualisation and shifted to its new open world paradigm with *Origins*. 

With Zelda, each game is something new an unexpected. The progression of *The Legend of Zelda* to *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link* to *A Link to the Past* to *Links Awakening* to *Ocarina of Time* to *Majora's Mask* to *Wind Waker* to *Twilight Princess* to *Skyward Sword* to *Breath of the Wild* looks very different to the labyrinthine *Call of Duty 1*, *2*, *3*, *Modern Warfare*, *World at War*, *MW2*, *Black Ops*, *MW3, BO II, Ghosts, Advanced Warfare, BO III, Infinite Warfare, WWII, BO4, Modern Warfare* (again), *Warzone*, *BO Cold War*.

# Mythic structure

What allows for that balance between familiarity and strangeness, I believe, from the worldbuilding or more specifically mythmaking that the series revolves around.

With notable exceptions, each games
