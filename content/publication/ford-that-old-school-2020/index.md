abstract: What is 'old school' about emphOld School RuneScape? In this presentation,
  I discuss the history of the MMORPG emphRuneScape and the steps that led to Jagex
  in 2013 releasing a version of the game from 2007, titled emphOld School RuneScape,
  alongside their flagship iteration of the MMO, emphRuneScape 3. Through a lens of
  myth, I argue that a communal process of mythmaking is at the heart of emphOld School
  as players debate with each other and with the developers over the correct way to
  retrive the nostalgic object and lost time of emphRuneScape circa 2007.
