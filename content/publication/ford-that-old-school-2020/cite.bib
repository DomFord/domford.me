 abstract = {What is 'old school' about \emphOld School RuneScape? In this presentation, I discuss the history of the MMORPG \emphRuneScape and the steps that led to Jagex in 2013 releasing a version of the game from 2007, titled \emphOld School RuneScape, alongside their flagship iteration of the MMO, \emphRuneScape 3. Through a lens of myth, I argue that a communal process of mythmaking is at the heart of \emphOld School as players debate with each other and with the developers over the correct way to retrive the nostalgic object and lost time of \emphRuneScape circa 2007.},
