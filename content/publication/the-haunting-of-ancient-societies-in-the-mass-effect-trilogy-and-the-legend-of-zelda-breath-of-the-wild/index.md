abstract: "I examine the prevalent construction of the long-lost yet
  technologically more highly-advanced society in the Mass Effect trilogy and
  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. First, I situate this construction
  within its long history, which finds a common touchstone in the myth of
  Atlantis. Through the lens of Jacques Derrida's hauntology, I consider how
  this construction is used in these two popular and prevalent yet different
  examples to evoke nostalgia for their own fictional pasts. I analyse the ways
  in which the ghosts of these gameworlds haunt the player in the present,
  through modalities of threat, nostalgia, lost futures and destiny. These
  manifest on various levels of the game: the gameworlds' fictional pasts (often
  overlapping with what would popularly be called a game's \"lore\"); digital
  materiality; and the games' spatial environments and the traversal of them.
  The examples differ in how and why the player interfaces with the gameworlds'
  ghosts on each layer, opening up some of the potential strategies for this
  game-internal nostalgia and haunting, while not being exhaustive."
