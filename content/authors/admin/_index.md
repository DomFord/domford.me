I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bremen, part of the [Literatures and Media of Religion](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/religionswissenschaft/profile-research/literatures-and-media-of-religions) lab headed by Kerstin Radde-Antweiler. At Bremen, I'm also a member of the [Institute for the Study of Religion and Related Didactics](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/religionswissenschaft) and the [ZeMKI Centre for Media, Communication and Information Research](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/zemki/). My postdoc project centres on community formation in digital games. I used a framework of mythmaking expanded from my PhD dissertation.

I did my PhD at the IT University of Copenhagen's [Center for Digital Play](https://digitalplay.itu.dk/). My dissertation, _[Mytholudics: Understanding Games As/Through Myth](https://domford.net/publication/ford-mytholudics-2022/)_, proposes a method for analysing games both as conduits of mythologies within society and as mythological structures in themselves.

This helps us to see how a gameworld constructs its world and the rules by which it operates, and how that world becomes so easy and intuitive for players to inhabit. The same method could be used in the construction of a gameworld, allowing for harmony and resonances between themes and motifs without there having to be a strict or explicit narrative coherence.

I'm also the managing editor for the academic journal _[gamevironments](https://journals.suub.uni-bremen.de/index.php/gamevironments/)_ and on the editorial board for _[Eludamos: Journal for Computer Game Culture](https://eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos)_.

This is my website where you'll find links to all the other relevant internet places you can find me at, all of my publications, games and other projects, and the occasional blog post whenever I feel like writing something here.

All of my publications here have a link or download where you can read it for free. If that is ever not the case, please contact me and I will happily send you a copy directly and make one available online.
