I'm a PhD student at the IT University of Copenhagen. My thesis is on using myth as a framework for understanding how games produce meaning through, within and about culture.

This is my website where you'll find links to all the other relevant internet places you can find me at, all of my publications, and the occasional blog post whenever I feel like writing something there.

All of my publications here have a link or download where you can read it for free. If that is ever not the case, please contact me and I will happily send you a copy directly and make one available online.
